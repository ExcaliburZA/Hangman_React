A word is randomly selected as the answer word when the app is launched.

Users must try to guess what the word is letter by letter by inputting letters in the designated input text field.
Users can then submit their letter by clicking the submit button at which point the app will either display the letter if it correct, or draw one more section of the hangman picture and consume a guess if it is wrong.

The user needs to guess the word with no more than 9 wrong attempts. 

Once the word has either been guessed completely or Steve the Stickman is hanging from the noose a message will be displayed informing the user of their result

The game can be reset at any time by clicking the reset button at the bottom of the page
